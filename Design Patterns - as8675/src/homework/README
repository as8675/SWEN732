The project is designed around implementing a catering system for RIT, utilizing the Visitor design pattern to efficiently manage various catering services, including food and dessert options. The core of the system revolves around two main components: the RITCateringService interface, which defines the structure for catering services, and the RITCateringVisitor interface, which facilitates operations on these services without altering their classes.

Concrete classes like RITFoodCatering and RITDessertCatering represent specific services offered, encapsulating details such as pricing and discounts. Visitor implementations, including PriceCalculator and DiscountCalculator, are used to perform operations across these services â€” calculating the total price and applying discounts, respectively. This architecture not only promotes the separation of concerns but also enhances the system's flexibility and extensibility, allowing for easy addition of new services or operations without impacting existing functionality.

By adopting the Visitor pattern, the project aims to demonstrate a structured and scalable approach to software design, catering to the dynamic needs of a large institution like RIT with minimal code intrusion and maximum maintainability.
